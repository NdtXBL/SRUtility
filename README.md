# SRUtility
SRUtility is a tool designed to assist in speedrun verification and preservation. The main focus of this project is to streamline the retiming process as well as storing runs or categories on your computer that may get deleted from the leaderboards.

Some features SRUtility has to offer is:
- Library: store speedruns on your computer including the game and category info
- Splits Tool: modify, create, or export splits, even allowing you to import splits from Splits.IO or your hard drive
- Retime Tool: retime runs on the go without having to download the VODs on your computer
- Speedrun Porting Tool: import games, categories, profiles, or runs directly from speedrun.com to your library
- Game Transfer: import/export games and all of its contents directly from your library which can be used as a backup or even transferred to other users
- Moderation Tool: Retime speedruns which are pulled directly from speedrun.com without having to copy links

Tips:
- Pasting a speedrun.com run URL on the retime tool will boot up the video and/or splits linked to that run. This applies to the splits.io porting tool as well.
- You can set custom keybinds in the settings, which can be used to trigger actions (i.e. skip 20 seconds, skip 1 frame, pause video, etc.)
- You can use the moderation tool right away after creating a profile and setting that profile as the main user in the settings.
